  "message": "containerd 1.0.0-beta.1\n\nWelcome to the second beta release of `containerd`.\n\nThe highlights of this release focus around making integrations much easier.\nThe `Container.Extensions` field allows one to add arbitrary metadata, such as\nprotobufs and json, to a container metadata object. The `Tasks.Wait` rpc makes\nwaiting for containers to exit much simpler in practice.\n\nWith this release, `containerd` now fully supports pulling multi-platform\nDocker and OCI images, complete with foreign layer support.\n\nPlease try out the release binaries and report any issues at\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues.\n\nUpgrading\n\nLabel validation now requires that the key and value together are under 4096\nbytes. If you had labels large than this size, metadata objects may need to be\nrewritten.\n\nThe metrics API has been moved from `/metrics` to be versioned under\n`/v1/metrics` and is now slated to be covered under our release policy.\n\nThe `Tasks` service now has a `Wait` rpc to make it easier to wait on container\nprocesses, eliminating race conditions that were hard to handle with events.\nOld clients will still work with events, but they will suffer from the problems\nthat this change is meant to solve.\n\nMulti-Platform\n\nWhile `containerd` is fairly agnostic to the image format, the release of\nmulti-platform images on Docker Hub caused some issues with the client-side\npull support. `containerd` now properly handles multi-platform Docker and OCI\nimages. This includes support for foreign layers.\n\nThis means that one should be able to pull multi-platform images without issues\nfor Linux and Windows, as well as most architectures. This works even if the\nplatform doesn't support the particular image.\n\nContainer Extensions\n\nA new field, `Container.Extensions`, supports storing integration specific\nstructures directly in `containerd`. This allows drivers like Docker and\nCRI-containerd to store their own metadata objects in `containerd`. This\nobviates the need for secondary storage systems and ensures updates follow the\nsame transaction semantics as other parts of `containerd`.
