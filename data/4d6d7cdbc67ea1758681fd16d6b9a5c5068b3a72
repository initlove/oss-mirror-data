However, this may cause issues in future\nreleases (and/or when trying to use packages which are included by the \"shim\").\n\nIn order to avoid any issues, users are advised to manually vendor the \"shim\"\npackage with their chaincode prior to using the peer CLI for packaging and/or\nfor installing chaincode.\n\nPlease refer to https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-5177 for more details,\nand kindly be aware that given the above, we may end up changing the\nfabric-ccenv in the future.\n\nChange Log\n----------\nhttps://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/v1.0.4/CHANGELOG.md#v104\n",
