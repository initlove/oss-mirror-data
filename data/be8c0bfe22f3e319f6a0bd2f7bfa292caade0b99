  "message": "8.4.3 (api:genl1/proto:86-101)\n--------\n * Changes from drbd-8.3.14 and drbd-8.3.15\n   * Do not end up in Unconnected state if the connection breaks at a\n     certain point during the handshake (was introduced with 8.3.12)\n   * Closed a race condition between promoting and connection handshake,\n     that could lead to an inconsistent view of the peer's UUIDS\n   * Fixed a race condition that could lead to a full sync, if connection\n     breaks at a certain point while starting a regular resync\n   * Fixed crm-fence-peer.sh for pacemaker 1.1.8\n   * Fixed a list corruption for read requests that complete with an error\n     after they were aborted\n   * Fixed a kernel panic if the device size was an exact multiple of 128MiB\n   * Fixed a potential memory allocation during deadlock online resize\n   * Improve the handling of read-errors: Make sure that sectors that had a\n     read error are overwritten with data from the peer on the next resync\n   * Expose the data-generation-uuids through /sys/block/drbdXX/drbd/\n   * The new flag --peer-max-bio-size for drbdmeta create-md is of use\n     if you plan to use the device for long time without peer\n * Fixed a potential protocol error and resulting disconnect/reconnect,\n   when a disk fails on the secondary node. (Introduced with 8.4.2)\n * Do not fail empty flushed on diskless, primary node\n * Fixed calculation of master scores for single volume and\n   unconfigured resources in the drbd.ocf RA\n * When the connection breaks during a grace full disconnect DRBD failed\n   to call the eventually configured fence-peer handler. Fixed.\n * Obey md-barrier setting when changed via the disk-options command\n * Non blocking queuing of AL-updates; This change significantly\n   improves the number of IOPs in case the workload does not fit into\n   the configured AL size. (Backport from drbd-9)\n * New options for drbdmeta create-md --al-stripes and --al-stripe-size\n   to create a larger and striped AL\n * Fixed drbdadm adjust of max-bio-bvecs\n * Fixed a memory leak of 336 byte per attach/detach cycle\n * Fix a potential null-pointer deference when configuring invalid\n   resync after dependencies\n * Compiles on Linux v3.7\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQBREUD/absdXACqiTMRAkCKAJ0UuoRJ0XN/1NXoXADzRQGxtNyHmACgpWJZ\nX6yNqrTNMn/Xam7YeUvOLQE=\n=64vh\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
