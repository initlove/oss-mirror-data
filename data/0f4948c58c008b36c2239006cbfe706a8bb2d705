The conversion has also\n    brought several improvements:\n\n    - Added 'b' and 't' mode to large objects: write can deal with both\n      bytes strings and unicode; read can return either bytes strings\n      or decoded unicode.\n    - COPY sends Unicode data to files implementing 'io.TextIOBase'.\n    - Improved PostgreSQL-Python encodings mapping.\n    - Added a few missing encodings: EUC_CN, EUC_JIS_2004, ISO885910,\n      ISO885916, LATIN10, SHIFT_JIS_2004.\n    - Dropped repeated dictionary lookups with unicode query/parameters.\n\n  - Improvements to the named cusors:\n\n    - More efficient iteration on named cursors, fetching 'itersize'\n      records at time from the backend.\n    - The named cursors name can be an invalid identifier.\n\n  - Improvements in data handling:\n\n    - Added 'register_composite()' function to cast PostgreSQL\n      composite types into Python tuples/namedtuples.\n    - Adapt types 'bytearray' (from Python 2.6), 'memoryview' (from\n      Python 2.7) and other objects implementing the \"Revised Buffer\n      Protocol\" to 'bytea' data type.\n    - The 'hstore' adapter can work even when the data type is not\n      installed in the 'public' namespace.\n    - Raise a clean exception instead of returning bad data when\n      receiving bytea in 'hex' format and the client libpq can't parse\n      them.\n    - Empty lists correctly roundtrip Python -> PostgreSQL -> Python.\n\n  - Other changes:\n\n    - 'cursor.description' is provided as named tuples if available.\n    - The build script refuses to guess values if 'pg_config' is not\n      found.\n    - Connections and cursors are weakly referenceable.\n\n* Bug fixes:\n\n  - Fixed adaptation of None in composite types (ticket #26).
