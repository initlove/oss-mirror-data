  "message": "containerd 1.0.0-alpha4\n\nWith this weeks release, we are starting to become more stable. Many\nfixes related to rounding out core features and usability. We have our\nfirst documentation available, oriented towards getting started with\ncontainerd.\n\nThis is the first release where we have no backwards incompatible\nchanges to the GRPC API. There are some changes to the metadata storage\nlayout, so please check upgrading for details.\n\nPlease download the binaries provided and let the bears get at 'em.\nPlease report issues through\nhttps://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues. Your feedback is\nextremely important at this stage, so please don't be bashful about\nletting us know what you think.\n\nUpgrading\n\nWith respect to the GRPC API, there have only been additions to add\nlabels to snapshot. All existing integrations should continue working\nwith this release without changes.\n\nThe storage format has had some changes to store labels and runc state\nhas been relocated. Removing the contents of `/var/lib/containerd` is\nrecommend before running this new version. This will cause loss of\ncontainers and image data. Let us know if this is a problem.\n\nDocumentation\n\nWe now have guides for [Getting\nStarted](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md),\n[Operations](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/docs/ops.md)\nand [Namespacing and\nMulti-tenancy](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/docs/namespaces.md).\nPlease take some time to read them and get to know containerd.\n\nThe [godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/containerd/containerd) has also\nbeen updated with new descriptions.\n\nSnapshot Labels\n\nSnapshots can now be decorated with labels on `Prepare`, `Commit` and\n`Update`. This is useful to associated snapshots with various components\nin containerd.\n\nSnapshot Command\n\nThe arguments naming and order now correctly match the `Snapshotter`\ninterface. Ordering of arguments may be affected. Make sure to use the\nhelp before using these commands if you are unsure.\n\nState Directory\n\nThe runtime state directory has been brought back. Previously, this\nstored ephemeral container data associated with running containers. It\nwas removed because checkpoint data was much too large for `tmpfs` used\nfor the the `/run` directory. The checkpoint data is now in the main\ncontainerd directory, while the ephemeral data resides in\n`/run/containerd`. Access performance for `runc` should increase and old\nruntime data should be cleaned up on reboot with this change.\n\nAPI stability\n\nTooling for GRPC API stability has been added. When protobufs are\nbuilt, the descriptors for the entire symbol set that make up the API\nare aggregated into a single file. Changes that affect the API will show\nin these files, making it much easier to identify differences that\naren't apparent in proto files. At each minor release, these files will\nbe snapshotted.\n\nGo API Additions\n\nWhile there are several changes to the Go API, a few highlights include\nan option to kill the process process on delete, `WithProcessKill` and\nthe ability to set the cgroup path and hostname options on the the runc\nspecification.\n\nSolaris Build Support\n\nThe project now builds on solaris.\n\nContributors\n\nA special thanks to all those that contributed to this release:\n\nAkihiro Suda\nEdward Pilatowicz\nKenfe-MickaÃ«l Laventure\nLantao Liu\nMichael Crosby\nPhil
