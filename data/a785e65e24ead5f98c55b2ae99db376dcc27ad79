  "message": "Felix version 2.1.0\n\n- Port dataplane driver to Golang and move in-process (#1202).\n  This has a number of benefits and allowed for a number of\n  bugfixes and enhancements to be worked in:\n\n  - Improve dataplane programming performance and decrease\n    occupancy by having only one process instead of two.\n    It also simplifies the codebase substantially.\n  - Simplify deployment (now only one binary needed).\n  - Use netlink directly for critical-path route programming\n    operations.\n  - Move to a synchronization model for route programming.\n    Allows for monitoring and restoring routes if they are\n    removed.  Allows for clean up of routes that relate to\n    orphaned endpoints.\n  - Ensure IPIP tunnel device configuration is maintained;\n    replace it if it is accidentally removed.\n  - Retry iptables/ipset updates in more failure cases to work\n    around transient failures of those commands.\n  - Switch to a synchronisation model for iptables.  Avoid\n    reprogramming rules that haven't changed.  This improves\n    performance.\n  - Label our iptables rules with a hash to allow rules to be\n    identified.  Allows for simpler sync and cleanup.\n  - Limit OpenStack special-case rules to deployments with \"tap\"\n    devices (#1020).\n\n- Add support for host endpoint policies that bypass the conntrack\n  table.  Useful for high connection throughput workloads such as\n  memcacheDB. (#1284)\n- Fix that setting LogFilePath doesn't prevent early logging (#803)\n- Fix log spam when adding tunl0 device (#1008)\n- Retry ipset commands to deal with transient failures (#1181)\n- Document deb/RPM release process (#1237)\n- Rev libcalico-go to v1.1.3, includes a number of fixes (#1364).\n",
