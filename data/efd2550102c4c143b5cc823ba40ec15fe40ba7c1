  "message": "CARE v2.2\n=========\n\n+ Special characters in environment variables are now correctly quoted\n  in the generated \"re-execute.sh\" script.  For instance, the value of\n  \"COMP_WORDBREAKS\" environment variable on Ubuntu used to make CARE\n  generate broken \"re-execute.sh\" scripts.\n\n+ It is now possible to deliver CARE as a dynamically linked binary.\n  In this case, the self-extracting format is not supported since one\n  can't assume the re-execution environment contains all the\n  pre-requisites (libtalloc, libarchive, proot).  Thus, CARE and PRoot\n  should be deployed independently on the re-execution environment.\n\n+ Syscall are now emulated only if it is really needed.\n\nThis release is based on PRoot v4.0.3, so it contains all the\nfollowing generic fixes too:\n\n  https://github.com/cedric-vincent/PRoot/releases/tag/v4.0.0\n  https://github.com/cedric-vincent/PRoot/releases/tag/v4.0.1\n  https://github.com/cedric-vincent/PRoot/releases/tag/v4.0.2\n  https://github.com/cedric-vincent/PRoot/releases/tag/v4.0.3\n",
