  "message": "8.4.2 (api:genl1/proto:86-101)\n--------\n * Fixed IO resuming after connection was established before fence\n   peer handler returned\n * Fixed an issue in the state engine that could cause state lockup\n   with multiple volumes\n * Write all pages of the bitmap if it gets moved during an\n   online resize operation. (This issue was introduced with 8.3.10)\n * Fixed a race condition could cause DRBD to go through a\n   NetworkFailure state during disconnect\n * Fixed a race condition in the disconnect code path that\n   could lead to a BUG() (introduced with 8.4.0)\n * Fixed a write ordering problem on SyncTarget nodes for a write to a block\n   that gets resynced at the same time. The bug can only be triggered with a\n   device that has a firmware that actually reorders writes to the same\n   block (merged from 8.3.13)\n * Fixed a potential deadlock during restart of conflicting writes\n * Disable the write ordering method \"barrier\" by default, since it is not\n   possible for a driver to find out if it works reliably since 2.6.36\n * All fixes that went into 8.3.13\n * Removed a null pointer access when using on-congestion policy on a\n   diskless device\n * In case of a graceful detach under IO load, wait for the outstanding\n   IO. (As opposed to aborting IOs as a forcefully detach does)\n * Reinstate disabling AL updates with invalidate-remote (8.4.0 regression)\n * Reinstate the 'disk-barrier no', 'disk-flushes no', and 'disk-drain no'\n   switches (8.4.0 regression)\n * Backported the request code from DRBD-9. Improves handling of many corner\n   cases.\n * Support FLUSH/FUA bio flags\n * Made the establishing of connections faster\n * New option 'al-updates no' to disable writing transactions into the\n   activity log. It is use full if you prefer a full sync after a primary\n   crash, for improved performance of a spread out random write work load\n * Expose the data generation identifies via sysfs\n * \"--stop\" option for online verify to specify a stop sector\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQBQSHJcabsdXACqiTMRAommAJ9HjvvTj3/w4qT4Gzs78Y1lwhNW3wCgokrP\nmlb4JAZC1x40MKIUnydMUUU=\n=YicF\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
