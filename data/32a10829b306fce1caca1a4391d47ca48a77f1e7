  "message": "Qhull 2019.1 2019/06/21 (7.3.2) released\n\nQhull 2019.1 contains bug fixes and improvements to logging, error reporting, and merging.\n- Fixed fifty bugs, including initialization bugs and memory corruption bugs\n  in qh_readpoints and qh_option. See Bugs and Changes.txt.\n\n- New option 'TAn' stops Qhull after adding n points.\n- New option 'Tf' flushes qh_fprintf. Use 'Tf' when debugging segfaults.\n- New options '--help', '-?', and '--' display a short help message.\n  Under Git for Windows or MSYS2, 'qhull' waits for stdin.\n\n- Option 'TP-1' turns on tracing after qh_buildhull and qh_postmerge complete.\n  It traces qh_check_maxout, qh_prepare_output, qh_triangulate, and qh_voronoi_center\n- Options 'TI' and 'TO' do not require a space before the filename.\n\n- An unknown Qhull option is an error. It was a warning. Override with option 'Qw'.\n- Short or long input to Qhull is an error. It was a warning. Override with option 'Qa'.\n\n- Documentation encourages the use of joggled input. Joggled input is less precise than facet merging, but it cannot incur merge errors for degenerate input.\n- Documentation refers to 'dupridge' instead of 'duplicate ridge'. A dupridge is an erroneous ridge between four or more facets.\n- Fixed documentation for qh_findbestfacet.\n  Delaunay triangulations may return an adjacent triangle [F. Drielsma].\n\n- CMake: export QhullTargets for config.cmake.in and find_package [tamasmeszaros]\n- The C++ interface includes new methods, hasNext() and hasPrevious(), for QhullFacet and QhullVertex.\n- Test scripts qtest.sh and q_benchmark help with logging and optimizing Qhull,\n  particularly for intermittent errors and bad cases for Qhull.\n\nFixed bugs in Qhull 2015.2 (see Changes.txt for the full list)\n- qh_buildcone_onlygood ('Qg') corrupted memory if it called qh_delfacet.\n- qh_check_maxout did not include qh.DISTround when checking f.maxoutside\n- qh_distround did not acount for 'Rn' (random roundoff) in option 'QJn'\n- qh_findbestfacet should document that it may return an adjacent triangle for Delaunay triangulations [F. Drielsma]\n- qh_findfacet_all should not search visible facets or f.upperdelaunay facets [P. Virtanen, S. Dominguez, J.Arkin]\n- qh_findgood may report a bad facet for qh.GOODvertex ('QVn'). Restrict the search to good facets.\n- qh_freebuild deleted unattached ridges, leading to a double delete\n- qh_initial_hull tested 'maybe flipped' instead of 'clearly flipped'. As a result facets could be incorrectly oriented, leading immediately to 'Only 4 facets remain' [S. Caron, P. Virtanen, D. Sterratt, others]\n- qh_initstatistics was missing initialization. As a result, the final qh_checkoutput may be skipped.\n- qh_initstatistics cannot use qh_fprintf to report errors. Use qh_fprintf_stderr\n- qh_maxsimplex did not detect nearly flat simplices except for the last vertex. It assumed the max coordinate was approximately 1. As a result, Qhull reported false narrow hulls or false low dimensional inputs. [J.R. Roussel, D. Sterratt]\n- qh_option could overflow the qh.qhull_options buffer\n- qh_partitionpoint could leave an outside point before qh.next_facet, leading to a skipped point.\n- qh_stddev was incorrect. It should be sqrt of absolute value.\n\n- 'Qbb' scaled the last coordinate to qh.MAXwidth causing loss of precision. It should be qh.MAXabs_coord.\n- 'rbox' and 'user_eg3' returned non-zero exit status for their help prompt. Should be 0.\n- 'rbox Cn,r,m' does not produce points for 'rbox r'\n- An error in qh_initqhull_start2 could loop forever. Need to set qh.NOerrexit\n- Do not call qh_check_points ('Tv') if reporting an error and qh.FORCEoutput ('Po')\n- If 'd' or 'v' was used with 'H', memory corruption occurred. Should be disallowed.\n- Improved searching of coplanar facets by qh_findbesthorizon.\n- Options 'Pdk' and 'Pdk' always returned the closest facet. This should only occur with option 'Pg'.\n- PointCoordinates::appendPoints should not require whitespace after a point\n- Setting qh.MINoutside could lead to verification ('Tv') failures. Fixed by setting qh.KEEPnearinside and calling qh_partitionpoint in qh_partitionall\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n\niQEzBAABCAAdFiEEYx8J5UyMrPgB0ul93HcLaxzspUkFAl0Ws+oACgkQ3HcLaxzs\npUnkoAgAhW1J7Hn+Oae0Ifnfwsqlu4cQFIqCTzVfNARHdNh27WRthRwKugHYGW/6\nllE0E4zJnIRVeI95BZtV3SiTjm8YHaSwEi73+P3bKxUQSmS3GF1m1YPmZEKy9x0X\nBAVBpUBW5iOCeCUKr7za/qAbF03X7knkImJh/f6l6jM2bTcfrTXjZmVdMTlqQeRm\n481MMZ8h4LrhjatbOMwmTwclxHcLDtNquef+1PIOxYU7/XSW1CLeGLXNzeJworDY\n90EWtQyqx0zSpjTnGmjztTPqmXmzGDsOkyZyf86vYDcift+gj2bodat7K9dSLBFO\nR/DGOKFQycxd2i/cg4xG8PEcjVoIrg==\n=wDYV\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
