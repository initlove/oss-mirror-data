The problem was that if udev opens the device on the\n   Secondary side \"in the right moment\" the connection attempt was\n   aborted. Fixed that by waiting until udev closes the device\n   again. Improves connect speed!\n * Fix in memory alignment of DRBD's struct bio. Got offseted by one due to a\n   buggy compat code. Only affects architectures that choke on unaligned\n   word accesses. I.e. Power and ARM not x86_64.\n * Improve the quorum implementation, so that is works nicely with for the\n   purpose of replacing fencing with quorum in a Pacemaker setup. Quorum\n   lost affects the completion status of writes in flight; Quorum state is\n   visible to user-space; a new meta-data flags quorum-lost to handle a\n   corner case\n * Ensure compatibility with upstream Linux kernel 4.14\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1\n\niD8DBQBaM9luabsdXACqiTMRApLKAJwPB8KQDYTdr+gK1lTqwpej90TNUwCgvTcV\nFbey7H/JP9a8BF9Vnpv5I+Q=\n=GUhJ\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
