  "message": "containerd 1.0.0-alpha3\n\nAnother released alpha brings us closer to a stable release! This\nrelease contains more changes to the event system, cleanup of the\nprocess execution model and several bug fixes.\n\nPlease download the binaries provided and light them on fire. Please\nreport issues through https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues.\nYour feedback is extremely important at this stage, so please don't be\nbashful about letting us know what you think.\n\nUpgrading\n\nWith changes to the `Tasks` service and the `Events` service, it is\nrecommend to full upgrade containerd and any constituent shim processes.\nRunning with previous versions may effect task startup and event\ndistribution from the shim.\n\nThese changes were done to ensure API consistency.\n\nNo changes to the `ctr` tool or storage formats should affect\ncompatibility.\n\nIf there are  changes that affecting compatibility that weren't listed\nhere, please file an issue.\n\nProcess Exec\n\nMore work has been undertaken to merge the behavior of container tasks\nand exec processes. The `Task` object no longer exists. The user now\ninteracts with only processes. The main container processes is started\nthrough `Start` method, while processes can be added to the container\nwith `Exec`.\n\nEvent Filters\n\nEvents now support full filtering. Filters act on events at publish\ntime, per subscriber, allowing a subscriber to receive only relevant\nevents. The same filtering syntax and behavior used on other APIs has\nbeen added here except that we autogenerate the available fields using\nprotobuf definitions.\n\nThe following example will match all events having to do with tasks in\nthe `bb` namespace:\n\n```console\n$ ctr events 'topic~=/tasks/.+,namespace==bb'\n```\n\nEvent specific data can even be selected upon. The following example\nwill match *any* event that has a `container_id` field with the value\n`mycontainer`.\n\n```console\n$ ctr events 'event.container_id==mycontainer'\n```\n\nThe above will actually decode event data, if known to containerd, and\nmatch regardless of the particular type, allowing this to act on\nunrelated event types without changing syntax.\n\nEvents API\n\nThe `Publish` method no longer takes an `Envelope` message as an\nargument and a new `Forward` method has been added. While this change\nseems superficial, it actually has the effect of avoiding a\nserialization round trip when forwarding events from other backends,\nsuch as container shims.\n\nThis change is not backwards compatible with previous alpha releases.\n\nUnmanaged Root Filesystem\n\nContainer's can now be run without snapshots using the `ctr` tool. If\nthe `--rootfs` flag is provided, the positional argument for image will\nnow be interpreted as a filesystem path. The following is an example:\n\n```console\nctr run --rootfs --tty /my/root/fs mycontainer\n```\n\nShim CGroup\n\nContainer shims may not be started in a specific cgroup with a parameter\npassed at task creation time.\n\nChanges\n\n0fa76584 Merge pull request #1280 from stevvooe/alpha3\n916254e4 release: prepare for 1.0.0-alpha3\nc8b4e4db Merge pull request #1277 from crosbymichael/tty-block\nee2dea2b Merge pull request #1278 from stevvooe/update-oci-spec\nbf4838eb Shutdown console after process exits\n610e1a25 vendor: update OCI image-spec dependency\n8b0a0400 Merge pull request #1268 from crosbymichael/exec-state\nf945cdc7 Update windows locking code\nd18af869 Update for epoll console handling\ne827adaf Update windows with exec create/start actions\n83b27db9 Check status for stopped processes before wait\ncd00216f Rename TaskStatus to Status\n504033e3 Add Get of task and process state\n2974e485 Add no-criu flag for running tests\n9f089656 Change Exited/Status to SetExited/ExitStatus\na2a34519 Implement Exec + Start for tasks service\n63878d14 Add create/start to exec processes in shim\n2533bfea Merge pull request #1271 from stevvooe/autogenerate-fieldpaths\nc857ba2d events: autogenerate fieldpath filters\nbb7b41ad Merge pull request #1269 from stevvooe/plumb-correct-interfaces\n7ed88c1e linux/shim: use events.Publisher interface\n92d737f4 Merge pull request #1259 from dqminh/epoll-io\n834f55df Merge pull request #1264 from stevvooe/event-filters\naf2d7f0e events: initial support for filters\n4ba6d8e5 Merge pull request #1267 from crosbymichael/bump-runc\n2386062c Update runc to e775f0fba3ea329b8b766451c892c41a3d4\nce07fa04 Merge pull request #1263 from crosbymichael/no-shim-events\nf86d5ae0 Merge pull request #1262 from dmcgowan/more-snapshot-tests\n7b6ff6ec event forwarding without shim\n8e534658 use epoll to manage console i/o in linux\nd28126f0 Handle kernel related ci failure\na7c44f00 Add snapshot test cases for former issues\n20fa6aee Merge pull request #1182 from AkihiroSuda/rootfs\n183a6ca8 Merge pull request #1013 from AkihiroSuda/oci-export\nde2671b7 bump vendor for containerd/console update\nb518f11d client: add Import() and Export() for importing/exporting image\nin OCI format\n752d253f client, ctr: allow specifying unmanaged rootfs dir\n1a054c67 Merge pull request #1134 from crosbymichael/shim-cgroup\n4e299a9a Merge pull request #1254 from stevvooe/close-channel\n16797276 Merge pull request #1230 from\ndmcgowan/snapshot-client-testsuite\nfdea1cea Merge pull request #1256 from\ndmcgowan/fix-ingest-file-not-exists\nafe0ce35 Merge pull request #1255 from stevvooe/multi-delete\n585f7d64 Skip test on windows\nccbb0352 Convert file not exists to status not found\n83ac8748 cmd/ctr: allow deleting multiple containers at once\na1f75096 events: close channel explicitly\n98a86c4d Add ShimCgroup path for placing shim in cgroup\nd4349eff Merge pull request #1251 from crosbymichael/apparmor\na0a5cc77 Add user namespace support to client\nc3872b84 Move RootPath to fs package\nda5c72c3 Run snapshot test suite for metadata and client\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n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\n91J8d8Gm/6MPBlcpRC06\n=68Gn\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
