  "message": "-   Added: Set download URL via new setter\n-   Improvement: The order of the `controls` option now effects the order in the DOM - i.e. you can re-order the controls - Note: this may break any custom CSS you have setup. Please see the changes in the PR to the default SASS\n-   Fixed issue with empty controls and preview thumbs\n-   Fixed issue with setGutter call (from Sentry)\n-   Fixed issue with initial selected speed not working\n-   Added notes on `autoplay` config option and browser compatibility\n-   Fixed issue with ads volume not matching current content volume\n-   Fixed race condition where ads were loading during source change\n-   Improvement: Automatic aspect ratio for YouTube is now supported, meaning all aspect ratios are set based on media content - Note: we're now using a different API to get YouTube video metadata so you may need to adjust any CSPs you have setup\n-   Fix for menu in the Shadow DOM (thanks @emielbeinema)\n",
