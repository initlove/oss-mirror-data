  "message": "-   Improved the usage of the `ratio` config option; it now works as expected and for all video types. The default has not changed, it is to dynamically, where possible (except YouTube where 16:9 is used) determine the ratio from the media source so this is not a breaking change.\n-   Added new `ratio` getter and setter\n-   Fix: Properly clear all timeouts on destroy\n-   Fix: Allow absolute paths in preview thumbnails\n-   Improvement: Allow optional hours and ms in VTT parser in preview thumbnails\n",
