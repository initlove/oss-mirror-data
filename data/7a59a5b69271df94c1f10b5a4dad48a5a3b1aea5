The bug can only be triggered with a\n   device that has a firmware that actually reorders writes to the same\n   block (merged from 8.3.13)\n * Fixed a potential deadlock during restart of conflicting writes\n * All fixes that went into 8.3.13\n * Removed a null pointer access when using on-congestion policy on a\n   diskless device\n * In case of a graceful detach under IO load, wait for the outstanding\n   IO. (As opposed to aborting IOs as a forcefully detach does)\n * Reinstate disabling AL updates with invalidate-remote (8.4.0 regression)\n * Reinstate the 'disk-barrier no', 'disk-flushes no', and 'disk-drain no'\n   switches (8.4.0 regression)\n * Backported the request code from DRBD-9. Improves handling of many corner\n   cases.\n * Support FLUSH/FUA bio flags\n * Made the establishing of connections faster\n * New option 'al-updates no' to disable writing transactions into the\n   activity log. It is use full if you prefer a full sync after a primary\n   crash, for improved performance of a spread out random write work load\n * Expose the data generation identifies via sysfs\n * \"--stop\" option for online verify to specify a stop sector\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)\n\niD8DBQBQH/ROabsdXACqiTMRAsj6AKC97EAGYRLIIdrNysmcqKeZ7E+/yACfWeR8\npwq+Kg6yedxoAMeRzpQa3nY=\n=7j9j\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
