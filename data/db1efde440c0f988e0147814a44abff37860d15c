  "message": "Release v4.0.2\n==============\n\n+ Fix how the very first program is launched by PRoot.  Previously,\n  argv[0] was not preserved when the very first program was launched\n  through a symbolic link.  This old behavior used to bug programs\n  like Busybox and python-exec.  Thanks to \"hhm\", Ivailo \"fluxer\"\n  Monev, and Joakim Tjernlund for the bug reports.\n\n+ Fix renameat(2) sysexit support.  There was a bug in PRoot that was\n  exposed by the Aarch64 (a.k.a arm64) port only but that might affect\n  other architectures.\n\n+ Fix build for AArch64.  Thanks to Rémi Duraffort for the patches and\n  for the Debian/arm64 testing platform.\n\n+ Fix support for \"long\" socket paths.  These can only be 108 bytes\n  long; this limit might be easily reached with PRoot since the path\n  to the rootfs is always prepended.  The solution was to\n  automatically bind this long path to a shorter path.  This bug was\n  exposed by LibreOffice and Yocto's pseudo.  Thanks to Christophe\n  Guillon for the bug report.\n",
