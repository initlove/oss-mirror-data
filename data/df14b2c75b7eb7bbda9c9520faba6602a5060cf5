  "message": "containerd 1.0.0-alpha1\n\nWe have followed up the initial alpha with this second release. There are a\nlarge number of changes to focus on API stability, error handling and several\nbug fixes.\n\nAgain, please download the binaries provided and kick the tires. Please report\nissues through the https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues. Your\nfeedback is extremely important at this stage, so please don't be bashful about\nletting us know what you think.\n\nCommands Merged\n\nThe most visible changes to users will be that the `dist` command has now been\nmerged into `ctr`. We've found this to be much easier for demonstration,\ntesting and deployment. For the most part, this change has moved the\nsubcommands untouched under `ctr`.\n\nIn addition to the command merge, all commands that mutate labels were changed\nfrom `set-labels` to the shorter `label`.\n\nThe `snapshot` command has a few additions to display details in a tree format,\nas well as some tweaks to expose mounts. See 659e3d78 and 4dc02c09 for details.\n\nSince we are discussing command syntax, it is a good time to remind\nusers that cli behavior will not be covered by the 1.0 version\nguarantees. We will only guarantee behavior of GRPC APIs, although we'll\ntry to keep changes like this minimized.\n\nEvent Topics\n\nThe topics for task events have been tweaked to be more consistent. This could\neffect users that were matching on event topic. Please see a578730a for\ndetails.\n\nChanges\n\nA full list of changes is provided for your convenience:\n\n0b3e572b Merge pull request #1221 from stevvooe/alpha1\n6273d79c containerd: prepare for v1.0.0-alpha1\n28bb2b35 Merge pull request #1220 from stevvooe/release-target\n88656970 Makefile: add release target\n28e8d95a Merge pull request #1210 from dmcgowan/use-forked-tar\n72c59aeb Merge pull request #1154 from darkowlzz/1082-snapshot-prepare\n14e10c87 Merge pull request #1214 from jovizhangwei/fix\nb5267baa Merge pull request #1216 from tklauser/prctl-x-sys-unix\n834cafc2 Merge pull request #1206 from AkihiroSuda/improve-btrfs-error\n70dc92f1 Merge pull request #1217 from fate-grand-order/fixed\n0600753b Merge pull request #1208 from dmcgowan/tar-test\n648f82e4 Merge pull request #1211 from stevvooe/no-build-proto\nd3d1987f correct some misspellings to make Go Report more happy\n4dc02c09 cmd/ctr: add mount subcmd to snapshot & a flag in prepare\nbfa4b901 Use Prctl() and associated constants from x/sys/unix\n50c84c4d Claim Go 1.8.x version requirement in BUILDING.md\ne76357cb btrfs: improve an error string\na8504277 Merge pull request #1209 from stevvooe/remove-errors\n23aa4910 Use forked archive/tar package\n60792458 Replace uses of filepath.Join in Apply\n35d59004 Merge pull request #1207 from mlaventure/update-linux-events-topic\n1ecb2ea3 linux/shim: remove redundant topic prefix\n8d195132 Merge pull request #1195 from darkowlzz/tree\ne3a07b56 Makefile: no need to build protos binary\n6d0bcd5a linux, linux/shim: remove error definitions\n4a3f98cb Add link breakout checks and tests\n805654ab Merge pull request #1178 from rajasec/ctr-run-error\n728f8acc Fixing return error on run command\n123aab86 Merge pull request #1202 from stevvooe/add-go-report-card\n59b0fc31 Merge pull request #1204 from fate-grand-order/typo\ne4beb7c5 Use constants for runtime event topics\na578730a Update linux events topic\n58dfd56a fix some typos for reference/reference.go\n4888d40a Merge pull request #1203 from stevvooe/containerd-startup-version\n659e3d78 cmd/ctr: add tree subcommand in snapshot\n6cfdbb2a README: add go report card badge\n2a923f72 cmd/containerd: show version and revision on startup\n6d305c74 Merge pull request #1200 from stevvooe/image-is-found\n778b1f1c cmd/ctr: container list should not look up image\n52927e59 Merge pull request #1199 from dmcgowan/socket-directory-permissions\n528a9d87 Create socket parent directory with correct permissions\nafd533de Merge pull request #1197 from dmcgowan/fix-snapshot-client-panic\nfb7af302 Merge pull request #1198 from stevvooe/mark-ociimageconfig-childleess\n9f654b08 images: OCI image config is a childless data type\na220fb6b Fix panic in snapshotter when connection fails\n81b893ac Merge pull request #1194 from AkihiroSuda/nit-comment\na0664b5c comment: dist -> ctr\ne48ef84b Merge pull request #1190 from stevvooe/remove-dist-command\n98f6deb5 cmd/dist: completely remove dist command\n751598e8 Merge pull request #1189 from stevvooe/move-content-commands\n1db80ed9 cmd/{ctr, dist}: move content command to ctr\n695351f3 Merge pull request #1188 from stevvooe/move-images-command\n1905380a Merge pull request #1187 from stevvooe/use-protobuild\nf7306d7f cmd/{ctr,dist}: move images command to ctr\nd50e4bcd Merge pull request #1183 from mlaventure/move-tasklist-to-runtime\n6c925924 protobuild: replace protobuild command\n31324e54 Merge pull request #1181 from mlaventure/fix-races\na5b3038c Fix deadlock when task's exec start fails\n9dcf725b Fix data race when task's exec fails to start\nae334b04 Prevent a data race in client_test.go on test failure\nbf679063 Merge pull request #1186 from estesp/update-fifo-racefix\n5e594d03 Update containerd/fifo for race fix\n56a4023a Merge pull request #1184 from stevvooe/label-commands\na8b22549 cmd/{ctr,dist}: label can be a verb\n88c1db5c Move taskList to the runtime package\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n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\nSNgVxlqDgyUNPfvyXqj6\n=AxrK\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
