It follows all relevant\nstandards including ISO C11 and POSIX.1-2008.  It is also\ninternationalized and has one of the most complete\ninternationalization interfaces known.\n\nThe GNU C Library webpage is at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/\n\nPackages for the 2.19 release may be downloaded from:\n        http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libc/\n        http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/\n\nThe mirror list is at http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html\n\nNEWS for version 2.19\n=====================\n\n* The following bugs are resolved with this release:\n\n  156, 387, 431, 762, 832, 926, 2801, 4772, 6786, 6787, 6807, 6810, 6981,\n  7003, 9721, 9954, 10253, 10278, 11087, 11157, 11214, 12100, 12486, 12751,\n  12986, 13028, 13982, 13985, 14029, 14032, 14120, 14143, 14155, 14286,\n  14547, 14699, 14752, 14782, 14876, 14910, 15004, 15048, 15073, 15089,\n  15128, 15218, 15268, 15277, 15308, 15362, 15374, 15400, 15425, 15427,\n  15483, 15522, 15531, 15532, 15593, 15601, 15608, 15609, 15610, 15632,\n  15640, 15670, 15672, 15680, 15681, 15723, 15734, 15735, 15736, 15748,\n  15749, 15754, 15760, 15763, 15764, 15797, 15799, 15825, 15843, 15844,\n  15846, 15847, 15849, 15850, 15855, 15856, 15857, 15859, 15867, 15886,\n  15887, 15890, 15892, 15893, 15895, 15897, 15901, 15905, 15909, 15915,\n  15917, 15919, 15921, 15923, 15939, 15941, 15948, 15963, 15966, 15968,\n  15985, 15988, 15997, 16032, 16034, 16036, 16037, 16038, 16041, 16046,\n  16055, 16071, 16072, 16074, 16077, 16078, 16103, 16112, 16143, 16144,\n  16146, 16150, 16151, 16153, 16167, 16169, 16172, 16195, 16214, 16245,\n  16271, 16274, 16283, 16289, 16293, 16314, 16316, 16330, 16337, 16338,\n  16356, 16365, 16366, 16369, 16372, 16375, 16379, 16384, 16385, 16386,\n  16387, 16390, 16394, 16398, 16400, 16407, 16408, 16414, 16430, 16431,\n  16453, 16474, 16506, 16510, 16529\n\n* Slovenian translations for glibc messages have been contributed by the\n  Translation Project's Slovenian team of translators.\n\n* The public headers no longer use __unused nor __block.  This change is to\n  support compiling programs that are derived from BSD sources and use\n  __unused internally, and to support compiling with Clang's -fblock\n  extension which uses __block.\n\n* CVE-2012-4412 The strcoll implementation caches indices and rules for\n  large collation sequences to optimize multiple passes.  This cache\n  computation may overflow for large collation sequences and may cause a\n  stack or buffer overflow.  This is now fixed to use a slower algorithm\n  which does not use a cache if there is an integer overflow.\n\n* CVE-2012-4424 The strcoll implementation uses malloc to cache indices and\n  rules for large collation sequences to optimize multiple passes and falls\n  back to alloca if malloc fails, resulting in a possible stack overflow.\n  The implementation now falls back to an uncached collation sequence lookup\n  if malloc fails.\n\n* CVE-2013-4788 The pointer guard used for pointer mangling was not\n  initialized for static applications resulting in the security feature\n  being disabled. The pointer guard is now correctly initialized to a\n  random value for static applications. Existing static applications need\n  to be recompiled to take advantage of the fix (bug 15754).\n\n* CVE-2013-4237 The readdir_r function could write more than NAME_MAX bytes\n  to the d_name member of struct dirent, or omit the terminating NUL\n  character.  (Bugzilla #14699).\n\n* CVE-2013-4332 The pvalloc, valloc, memalign, posix_memalign and\n  aligned_alloc functions could allocate too few bytes or corrupt the\n  heap when passed very large allocation size values (Bugzilla #15855,\n  #15856, #15857).\n\n* CVE-2013-4458 Stack overflow in getaddrinfo with large number of results\n  for AF_INET6 has been fixed (Bugzilla #16072).\n\n* New locales: ak_GH, anp_IN, ar_SS, cmn_TW, hak_TW, lzh_TW, nan_TW, pap_AW,\n  pap_CW, quz_PE, the_NP.\n\n* Substantially revised locales: gd_GB, ht_HT\n\n* The LC_ADDRESS field was updated to support country_car for almost all\n  supported locales.\n\n* ISO 1427 definitions were updated.\n\n* ISO 3166 definitions were updated.\n\n* The localedef utility now supports --big-endian and --little-endian\n  command-line options to generate locales for a different system from that\n  for which the C library was built.\n\n* Binary locale files now only depend on the endianness of the system for\n  which they are generated and not on other properties of that system.  As a\n  consequence, binary files generated with new localedef may be incompatible\n  with old versions of the GNU C Library, and binary files generated with\n  old localedef may be incompatible with this version of the GNU C Library,\n  in the following circumstances:\n\n  + Locale files may be incompatible on m68k systems.\n\n  + Locale archive files (but not separate files for individual locales) may\n    be incompatible on systems where plain \"char\" is signed.\n\n* The configure option --disable-versioning has been removed.  Builds with\n  --disable-versioning had not worked for several years.\n\n* ISO 639 definitions were updated for Chiga (cgg) and Chinese (gan, hak, czh,\n  cjy, lzh, cmn, mnp, cdo, czo, cpx, wuu, hsn, yue).\n\n* SystemTap probes for malloc have been introduced.\n\n* SystemTap probes for slow multiple precision fallback paths of\n  transcendental functions have been introduced.\n\n* Support for powerpc64le has been added.\n\n* The soft-float powerpc port now supports e500 processors.\n\n* Support for STT_GNU_IFUNC symbols added for ppc32/power4+ and ppc64.\n\n* A new feature test macro _DEFAULT_SOURCE is available to enable the same\n  set of header declarations that are enabled by default, even when other\n  feature test macros or compiler options such as -std=c99 would otherwise\n  disable some of those declarations.\n\n* The _BSD_SOURCE feature test macro no longer enables BSD interfaces that\n  conflict with POSIX.  The libbsd-compat library (which was a dummy library\n  that did nothing) has also been removed.\n\n* Preliminary documentation about Multi-Thread, Async-Signal and\n  Async-Cancel Safety has been added.\n\nContributors\n============\n\nThis release was made possible by the contributions of many people.\nThe maintainers are grateful to everyone who has contributed\nchanges or bug reports.
