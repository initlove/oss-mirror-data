Can be important\n   if long lived DRBD connections go through a firewall with connection\n   tracking\n * automatically solve a specific split brain when quorum is enabled\n   and a node does no IO between losing connections to other nodes\n * Compat: Drop support for kernels older 2.6.32 and distros older than\n   RHEL6; Added support for kernels up to v4.15.x\n * new wire packet P_ZEROES a cousin of P_DISCARD, following the kernel\n   as it introduced separated BIO ops for writing zeros and discarding\n * compat workaround for two RHEL 7.5 idiosyncrasies regarding refcount_t\n   and struct nla_policy\n",
