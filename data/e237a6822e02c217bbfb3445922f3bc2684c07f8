  "message": "MooseFS 3.0.88\n\n * (mount) added read cache clean on write (same file access using different descriptors)\n * (mount) added missing cond_destroy in readdata.c (fix sent by Jakub Ratajczak)\n * (master) fixed initializing packet size for reading 'sustained' directory\n * (all) fixed zassert for printing correct statuses in case of pthread functions\n * (mount) fix fleng in finfo after truncate (patched by Davies Liu)\n * (mount) fix overlapped read (patched by Davies Liu)\n * (mount) fixed invalidating chunk cache after truncate\n * (mount) fixed fleng handling in read worker\n * (mount) fixed handling BREAK state in read worker\n * (mount) changed handling data invalidation in read module (sometimes could be less efficient, but it is much more safer)\n * (tools) fixed number parsing (patched by Paweł Gawroński)\n * (cli) fixed printed host/port options\n * (mount) moved pipes from requests to workers (read and write - huge decrease of descriptors used by mount)\n * (mount) changed signal to broadcast in rwlock (fixed very rare read/write deadlock)\n * (mount) fixed 'open descriptors' leak (lookup(with data for open)->open(with cached data)->close)\n * (mount) fixed potential 'race condition' - free 'csdata' during access\n * (master) split (only internally) sustained folder into 256 subfolders (too many sustained files caused socket timeouts in master)\n",
