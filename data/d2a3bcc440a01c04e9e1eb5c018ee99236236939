Added support for read-only sessions and, for PostgreSQL\n  9.1, for the \"repeatable read\" isolation level and the \"deferrable\"\n  transaction property.\n- Psycopg doesn't execute queries at connection time to find the\n  default isolation level.\n- Fixed bug with multithread code potentially causing loss of sync\n  with the server communication or lock of the client (ticket #55).\n- Don't fail import if mx.DateTime module can't be found, even if its\n  support was built (ticket #53).\n- Fixed escape for negative numbers prefixed by minus operator\n  (ticket #57).\n- Fixed refcount issue during copy.  Reported and fixed by Dave\n  Malcolm (ticket #58, Red Hat Bug 711095).\n- Trying to execute concurrent operations on the same connection\n  through concurrent green thread results in an error instead of a\n  deadlock.\n- Fixed detection of pg_config on Window.
