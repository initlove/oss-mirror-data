Improvements mostly due\n  to moving to 32-bit indices, faster shuffling kernels.  More improvements to\n  come in later releases.\n\nBug fixes\n\n* Lots of fixes to documentation and tutorials, many contributed\n  by the public.\n\n* 271 closed issues on github issues.\n\nBackwards-incompatible changes\n\n* tf.nn.fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler changed its default 'distortion'\n  attribute from 0.0 to 1.0. This was a bug in the original release\n  that is now fixed.\n",
