This should only be\n  a problem for derivative themes that have overridden styling of nav elements\n  using direct decendant selectors. See #215 for more information.\n* Safari overscroll bug fixed\n* Version added to the nav header\n* Revision id was added to the documentation footer if you are using RTD\n* An extra block, ``extrafooter`` was added to allow extra content in the\n  document footer block\n* Fixed modernizr URL\n* Small display style changes on code blocks, figure captions, and nav elements\n",
