  "message": "The GNU C Library\n=================\n\nThe GNU C Library version 2.23 is now available.\n\nThe GNU C Library is used as *the* C library in the GNU system and\nin GNU/Linux systems, as well as many other systems that use Linux\nas the kernel.\n\nThe GNU C Library is primarily designed to be a portable\nand high performance C library.  It follows all relevant\nstandards including ISO C11 and POSIX.1-2008.  It is also\ninternationalized and has one of the most complete\ninternationalization interfaces known.\n\nThe GNU C Library webpage is at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/\n\nPackages for the 2.23 release may be downloaded from:\n        http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libc/\n        http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/\n\nThe mirror list is at http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html\n\nNEWS for version 2.23\n=====================\n\n* Unicode 8.0.0 Support: Character encoding, character type info, and\n  transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 8.0.0, using new\n  and/or improved generator scripts contributed by Mike FABIAN (Red Hat).\n  These updates cause user visible changes, such as the fixes for bugs\n  89, 16061, and 18568.\n\n* sched_setaffinity, pthread_setaffinity_np no longer attempt to guess the\n  kernel-internal CPU set size.  This means that requests that change the\n  CPU affinity which failed before (for example, an all-ones CPU mask) will\n  now succeed.  Applications that need to determine the effective CPU\n  affinities need to call sched_getaffinity or pthread_getaffinity_np after\n  setting it because the kernel can adjust it (and the previous size check\n  would not detect this in the majority of cases).\n\n* The fts.h header can now be used with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.  With LFS\n  the following new symbols are used: fts64_children, fts64_close,\n  fts64_open, fts64_read and fts64_set.\n\n* getaddrinfo now detects certain invalid responses on an internal netlink\n  socket.  If such responses are received, an affected process will\n  terminate with an error message of \"Unexpected error <number> on netlink\n  descriptor <number>\" or \"Unexpected netlink response of size <number> on\n  descriptor <number>\".  The most likely cause for these errors is a\n  multi-threaded application which erroneously closes and reuses the netlink\n  file descriptor while it is used by getaddrinfo.\n\n* A defect in the malloc implementation, present since glibc 2.15 (2012) or\n  glibc 2.10 via --enable-experimental-malloc (2009), could result in the\n  unnecessary serialization of memory allocation requests across threads.\n  The defect is now corrected.  Users should see a substantial increase in\n  the concurent throughput of allocation requests for applications which\n  trigger this bug.  Affected applications typically create create and\n  destroy threads frequently.  (Bug 19048 was reported and analyzed by\n  Ericsson.)\n\n* There is now a --disable-timezone-tools configure option for disabling the\n  building and installing of the timezone related utilities (zic, zdump, and\n  tzselect).  This is useful for people who build the timezone data and code\n  independent of the GNU C Library.\n\n* The obsolete header <regexp.h> has been removed.  Programs that require\n  this header must be updated to use <regex.h> instead.\n\n* The obsolete functions bdflush, create_module, get_kernel_syms,\n  query_module and uselib are no longer available to newly linked binaries;\n  the header <sys/kdaemon.h> has been removed.  These functions and header\n  were specific to systems using the Linux kernel and could not usefully be\n  used with the GNU C Library on systems with version 2.6 or later of the\n  Linux kernel.\n\n* Optimized string, wcsmbs and memory functions for IBM z13.\n  Implemented by Stefan Liebler.\n\n* Newly linked programs that define a variable called signgam will no longer\n  have it set by the lgamma, lgammaf and lgammal functions.  Programs that\n  require signgam to be set by those functions must ensure that they use the\n  variable provided by the GNU C Library and declared in <math.h>, without\n  defining their own copy.\n\n* The minimum GCC version that can be used to build this version of the GNU\n  C Library is GCC 4.7.  Older GCC versions, and non-GNU compilers, can\n  still be used to compile programs using the GNU C Library.\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n* An out-of-bounds value in a broken-out struct tm argument to strftime no\n  longer causes a crash.  Reported by Adam Nielsen.  (CVE-2015-8776)\n\n* The LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable can no longer be used to disable\n  the pointer guard feature.  It is always enabled.  Previously,\n  LD_POINTER_GUARD could be used to disable security hardening in binaries\n  running in privileged AT_SECURE mode.  Reported by Hector Marco-Gisbert.\n  (CVE-2015-8777)\n\n* An integer overflow in hcreate and hcreate_r could lead to an\n  out-of-bounds memory access.  Reported by Szabolcs Nagy.  (CVE-2015-8778)\n\n* The catopen function no longer has unbounded stack usage.  Reported by\n  Max.  (CVE-2015-8779)\n\n* The nan, nanf and nanl functions no longer have unbounded stack usage\n  depending on the length of the string passed as an argument to the\n  functions.  Reported by Joseph Myers.  (CVE-2014-9761)\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow was found in libresolv when invoked from\n  libnss_dns, allowing specially crafted DNS responses to seize control\n  of execution flow in the DNS client.  The buffer overflow occurs in\n  the functions send_dg (send datagram) and send_vc (send TCP) for the\n  NSS module libnss_dns.so.2 when calling getaddrinfo with AF_UNSPEC\n  family.  The use of AF_UNSPEC triggers the low-level resolver code to\n  send out two parallel queries for A and AAAA.  A mismanagement of the\n  buffers used for those queries could result in the response of a query\n  writing beyond the alloca allocated buffer created by\n  _nss_dns_gethostbyname4_r.  Buffer management is simplified to remove\n  the overflow.  Thanks to the Google Security Team and Red Hat for\n  reporting the security impact of this issue, and Robert Holiday of\n  Ciena for reporting the related bug 18665.

It follows all relevant\nstandards including ISO C11 and POSIX.1-2008.  It is also\ninternationalized and has one of the most complete\ninternationalization interfaces known.\n\nThe GNU C Library webpage is at http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/\n\nPackages for the 2.23 release may be downloaded from:\n        http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libc/\n        http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libc/\n\nThe mirror list is at http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html\n\nNEWS for version 2.23\n=====================\n\n* Unicode 8.0.0 Support: Character encoding, character type info, and\n  transliteration tables are all updated to Unicode 8.0.0, using new\n  and/or improved generator scripts contributed by Mike FABIAN (Red Hat).\n  These updates cause user visible changes, such as the fixes for bugs\n  89, 16061, and 18568.\n\n* sched_setaffinity, pthread_setaffinity_np no longer attempt to guess the\n  kernel-internal CPU set size.  This means that requests that change the\n  CPU affinity which failed before (for example, an all-ones CPU mask) will\n  now succeed.  Applications that need to determine the effective CPU\n  affinities need to call sched_getaffinity or pthread_getaffinity_np after\n  setting it because the kernel can adjust it (and the previous size check\n  would not detect this in the majority of cases).\n\n* The fts.h header can now be used with -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.  With LFS\n  the following new symbols are used: fts64_children, fts64_close,\n  fts64_open, fts64_read and fts64_set.\n\n* getaddrinfo now detects certain invalid responses on an internal netlink\n  socket.  If such responses are received, an affected process will\n  terminate with an error message of \"Unexpected error <number> on netlink\n  descriptor <number>\" or \"Unexpected netlink response of size <number> on\n  descriptor <number>\".  The most likely cause for these errors is a\n  multi-threaded application which erroneously closes and reuses the netlink\n  file descriptor while it is used by getaddrinfo.\n\n* A defect in the malloc implementation, present since glibc 2.15 (2012) or\n  glibc 2.10 via --enable-experimental-malloc (2009), could result in the\n  unnecessary serialization of memory allocation requests across threads.\n  The defect is now corrected.  Users should see a substantial increase in\n  the concurent throughput of allocation requests for applications which\n  trigger this bug.  Affected applications typically create create and\n  destroy threads frequently.  (Bug 19048 was reported and analyzed by\n  Ericsson.)\n\n* There is now a --disable-timezone-tools configure option for disabling the\n  building and installing of the timezone related utilities (zic, zdump, and\n  tzselect).  This is useful for people who build the timezone data and code\n  independent of the GNU C Library.\n\n* The obsolete header <regexp.h> has been removed.  Programs that require\n  this header must be updated to use <regex.h> instead.\n\n* The obsolete functions bdflush, create_module, get_kernel_syms,\n  query_module and uselib are no longer available to newly linked binaries;\n  the header <sys/kdaemon.h> has been removed.  These functions and header\n  were specific to systems using the Linux kernel and could not usefully be\n  used with the GNU C Library on systems with version 2.6 or later of the\n  Linux kernel.\n\n* Optimized string, wcsmbs and memory functions for IBM z13.\n  Implemented by Stefan Liebler.\n\n* Newly linked programs that define a variable called signgam will no longer\n  have it set by the lgamma, lgammaf and lgammal functions.  Programs that\n  require signgam to be set by those functions must ensure that they use the\n  variable provided by the GNU C Library and declared in <math.h>, without\n  defining their own copy.\n\n* The minimum GCC version that can be used to build this version of the GNU\n  C Library is GCC 4.7.  Older GCC versions, and non-GNU compilers, can\n  still be used to compile programs using the GNU C Library.\n\nSecurity related changes:\n\n* An out-of-bounds value in a broken-out struct tm argument to strftime no\n  longer causes a crash.  Reported by Adam Nielsen.  (CVE-2015-8776)\n\n* The LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable can no longer be used to disable\n  the pointer guard feature.  It is always enabled.  Previously,\n  LD_POINTER_GUARD could be used to disable security hardening in binaries\n  running in privileged AT_SECURE mode.  Reported by Hector Marco-Gisbert.\n  (CVE-2015-8777)\n\n* An integer overflow in hcreate and hcreate_r could lead to an\n  out-of-bounds memory access.  Reported by Szabolcs Nagy.  (CVE-2015-8778)\n\n* The catopen function no longer has unbounded stack usage.  Reported by\n  Max.  (CVE-2015-8779)\n\n* The nan, nanf and nanl functions no longer have unbounded stack usage\n  depending on the length of the string passed as an argument to the\n  functions.  Reported by Joseph Myers.  (CVE-2014-9761)\n\n* A stack-based buffer overflow was found in libresolv when invoked from\n  libnss_dns, allowing specially crafted DNS responses to seize control\n  of execution flow in the DNS client.  The buffer overflow occurs in\n  the functions send_dg (send datagram) and send_vc (send TCP) for the\n  NSS module libnss_dns.so.2 when calling getaddrinfo with AF_UNSPEC\n  family.  The use of AF_UNSPEC triggers the low-level resolver code to\n  send out two parallel queries for A and AAAA.  A mismanagement of the\n  buffers used for those queries could result in the response of a query\n  writing beyond the alloca allocated buffer created by\n  _nss_dns_gethostbyname4_r.  Buffer management is simplified to remove\n  the overflow.  Thanks to the Google Security Team and Red Hat for\n  reporting the security impact of this issue, and Robert Holiday of\n  Ciena for reporting the related bug 18665.
