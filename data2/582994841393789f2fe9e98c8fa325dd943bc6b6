  "message": "Released v8.0.0\n\n* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Drop support for Python 3.2.\n\n* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the ability to find any files other than the\n  ones directly linked from the index or find-links pages.\n\n* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the ``--download-cache`` which had been\n  deprecated and no-op'd in 6.0.\n\n* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Remove the ``--log-explicit-levels`` which had been\n  deprecated in 6.0.\n\n* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Change pip wheel --wheel-dir default path from\n  <cwd>/wheelhouse to <cwd>.\n\n* Deprecate and no-op the ``--allow-external``, ``--allow-all-external``, and\n  ``--allow-unverified`` functionality that was added as part of PEP 438. With\n  changes made to the repository protocol made in PEP 470, these options are no\n  longer functional.\n\n* Allow ``--trusted-host`` within a requirements file. :issue:`2822`.\n\n* Allow ``--process-dependency-links`` within a requirements file. :issue:`1274`.\n\n* Allow ``--pre`` within a requirements file. :issue:`1273`.\n\n* Allow repository URLs with secure transports to count as trusted. (E.g.,\n  \"git+ssh\" is okay.) :issue:`2811`.\n\n* Implement a top-level ``pip download`` command and deprecate\n  ``pip install --download``.\n\n* Fixed :issue:`3141`, when uninstalling, look for the case of paths containing\n  symlinked directories (:pull:`3154`)\n\n* When installing, if building a wheel fails, clear up the build directory\n  before falling back to a source install. :issue:`3047`.\n\n* Fix user directory expansion when ``HOME=/``. Workaround for Python bug\n  http://bugs.python.org/issue14768, reported in :issue:`2996`.\n\n* Fixed :issue:`3009`, correct reporting of requirements file line numbers\n  (:pull:`3125`)\n\n* Fixed :issue:`1062`, Exception(IOError) for ``pip freeze`` and ``pip list``\n  commands with subversion >= 1.7. (:pull:`3346`)\n\n* Provide a spinner showing that progress is happening when installing or\n  building a package via ``setup.py``. This will alleviate concerns that\n  projects with unusually long build times have with pip appearing to stall.\n\n* Include the functionality of ``peep`` into pip, allowing hashes to be baked\n  into a requirements file and ensuring that the packages being downloaded\n  match one of those hashes. This is an additional, opt-in security measure\n  that, when used, removes the need to trust the repository.\n\n* Fix a bug causing pip to not select a wheel compiled against an OSX SDK later\n  than what Python itself was compiled against when running on a newer version\n  of OSX.\n\n* Add a new ``--prefix`` option for ``pip install`` that supports wheels and\n  sdists. (:pull:`3252`)\n\n* Fixed :issue:`2042` regarding wheel building with setup.py using a different\n  encoding than the system.\n\n* Drop PasteScript specific egg_info hack. (:pull:`3270`)\n\n* Allow combination of pip list options --editable with --outdated/--updtodate.\n  (:issue:`933`)\n\n* Gives VCS implementations control over saying whether a project\n  is under their control (:pull:`3258`)\n\n* Git detection now works when ``setup.py`` is not at the Git repo root\n  and when ``package_dir`` is used, so ``pip freeze`` works in more\n  cases (:pull:`3258`)\n\n* Correctly freeze Git develop packages in presence of the &subdirectory\n  option (:pull:`3258`)\n\n* The detection of editable packages now relies on the presence of ``.egg-link``\n  instead of looking for a VCS, so ``pip list -e`` is more reliable\n  (:pull:`3258`)\n\n* Add the ``--prefix`` flag to ``pip install`` which allows specifying a root\n  prefix to use instead of ``sys.prefix`` (:pull:`3252`).\n\n* Allow duplicate specifications in the case that only the extras differ, and\n  union all specified extras together (:pull:`3198`).\n\n* Fix the detection of the user's current platform on OSX when determining the\n  OSX SDK version (:pull:`3232`).\n\n* Prevent the automatically built wheels from mistakenly being used across\n  multiple versions of Python when they may not be correctly configured for\n  that by making the wheel specific to a specific version of Python and\n  specific interpreter (:pull:`3225`).\n\n* Emulate the SOABI support in wheels from Python 2.x on Python 2.x as closely\n  as we can with the information available within the interpreter\n  (:pull:`3075`).\n\n* Don't roundtrip to the network when git is pinned to a specific commit hash\n  and that hash already exists locally (:pull:`3066`).\n\n* Prefer wheels built against a newer SDK to wheels built against an older SDK\n  on OSX (:pull:`3163`).\n\n* Show entry points for projects installed via wheel (:pull:`3122`).\n\n* Improve message when an unexisting path is passed to --find-links option\n  (:issue:`2968`).\n\n* pip freeze does not add the VCS branch/tag name in the #egg=... fragment anymore\n  (:pull:`3312`).\n\n* Warn on installation of editable if the provided #egg=name part does not\n  match the metadata produced by `setup.py egg_info`. :issue:`3143`.\n\n* Add support for .xz files for python versions supporting them (>= 3.3).\n  :issue:`722`.\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nComment: GPGTools - https://gpgtools.org\n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\nnayCTsKdc+OZHrh2EHJY\n=vnII\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
