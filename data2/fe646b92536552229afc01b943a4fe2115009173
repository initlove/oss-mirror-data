  "message": "v1.0.0~rc7\n\nDue to CVE-2019-5736, we had to do another -rc release so users can update. We\nhope to be able to release 1.0.0 in the near future (there is still an\noutstanding spec-compliance issue with OCI hooks which we need to resolve\nfirst).\n\nThis also updates runc to a vendored commit of the runtime-spec rather than a\nfull release, which will hopefully be rectified with runc 1.0.0. #k\n\nSecurity:\n  + Mitigate CVE-2019-5736. This is an updated version of the patch series sent\n    out on openwall and we encourage users to update. #1982 #1984\n\n    NOTE: This mitigation *WILL NOT WORK* if you run untrusted containers with\n          host uid 0 and give them CAP_SYS_ADMIN (the protection operates\n          through a hidden read-only bind-mount which can be re-mounted by\n          CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileged users).\n\n          Put simply -- we consider granting CAP_SYS_ADMIN to untrusted\n          containers without user namespaces to be fundamentally insecure, as\n          such we do not consider this to be a security issue.\n\n          If you want an additional host-level mitigation, use `chattr +i` on\n          the host file to ensure containers without CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE cannot\n          write to it -- even with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. But as above, if you give\n          CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE to a container you will have problems.\n\n          An alternative is to bind-mount a sealed memfd copy of the runc\n          binary over the binary (runc will detect this and will not attempt\n          further mitigation, because sealed memfds are fundamentally\n          unmodifiable) but this requires more in-depth work by administrators.\n\n  + There appear to be production users of --no-pivot-root, which is something\n    that we absolutely recommend against and do not consider to be a secure\n    configuration -- since pivot_root(2) has many security properties that are\n    not possible to provide with just chroot(2).\n\n    However, a specific issue was discovered which we decided to mitigate in\n    order to avoid production users being exploited by it. This security issue\n    is *not* elligible for a CVE because it requires an insecure configuration\n    (--no-pivot-root). #1962\n\nFeatures:\n  + Add intelrdt support for MBA to runc (a new intelrdt feature available in\n    Linux 4.18+). #1919\n  + Add support for specifying a CRIU configuration file for checkpoint/restore\n    (which makes use of a new org.criu.config annotation). #1933 #1964\n  + Add support for \"runc exec --preserve-fds\". #1995\n  * Added support for SELinux labeling of keyrings. #2012\n\nFixes:\n  * Correct handling of \"runc kill\" when a container is stopped or paused.\n    #1934 #1943\n  * Error out if built with nokmem and kmemcg limits were requested. #1939\n  * Update check-config.sh to be in line with Docker's. #1942\n  * Improve handling of kmem and the systemd cgroup driver. #1960\n  * Improve resilience of adding setns tasks to cgroups. #1950\n  - Remove (broken) detection of .scope for systemd. #1978\n  * Fix console hanging with preserve-fds, where not enough fds have actually\n    been provided to runc (which is a very common mistake when using\n    --preserve-fds). #2000\n  * Create bind-mounts when restoring. #1968\n  * Fix regression of zombie \"runc init\" processes. #2023\n\nThanks to all of the contributors that made this release possible:\n\n * Ace-Tang <aceapril@126.com>\n * Adrian Reber <areber@redhat.com>\n * Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.de>\n * Alex Fang <littlelightlittlefire@gmail.com>\n * Christian Brauner <christian.brauner@ubuntu.com>\n * Daniel, Dao Quang Minh <dqminh89@gmail.com>\n * Daniel J Walsh <dwalsh@redhat.com>\n * Filipe Brandenburger <filbranden@google.com>\n * Giuseppe Scrivano <gscrivan@redhat.com>\n * JoeWrightss <zhoulin.xie@daocloud.io>\n * John Howard <jhoward@microsoft.com>\n * Justin Cormack <justin.cormack@docker.com>\n * Kenta Tada <Kenta.Tada@sony.com>\n * Lifubang <lifubang@acmcoder.com>\n * Michael Crosby <crosbymichael@gmail.com>\n * Mrunal Patel <mrunal@me.com>\n * Tom Godkin <tgodkin@pivotal.io>\n * Vincent Batts <vbatts@hashbangbash.com>\n * Xiaochen Shen <xiaochen.shen@intel.com>\n\nWith special thanks and well-wishes to Victor Marmol and Rohit Jnagal, who have\nboth decided to give up their maintainership.
