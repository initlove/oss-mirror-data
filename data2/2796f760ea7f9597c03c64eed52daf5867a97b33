  "message": "Version 0.9.0.\n\nThis release is meant to be the first \"complete\" release of the\nlibrary. Major changes include:\n\n- Support for C++98 and Microsoft Visual C++.\n- Switch to standard C++ only (for C++11, C++98 usage requires variadic\n  macros). No more weak symbols.\n- Ability to do everything at compile time, including trimming\n  initializers. This makes _to_string constexpr.\n- Non-throwing versions of conversion functions.\n- The library is now a single header file.\n\nThere are some interface-breaking changes:\n\n- to_string and to_integral are now prefixed with underscores. Not\n  having them prefixed before was an oversight.\n- Built-in range properties have been removed. They can be easily\n  computed by the user, if needed, as shown in the documentation.\n- _names, _values, and _name are now functions instead of values. This\n  is a result of how weak symbols were eliminated.\n",
