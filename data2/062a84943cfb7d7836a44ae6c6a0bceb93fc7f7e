  "message": "V2.97a.20120318 - Minor updates. from / to and onplay() bug fixes, canPlayMIME() and canPlayLink() Flash-specific corrections.\n\n    Bug fixes\n\n        Fix silly undefined\"soundID\" debug output message shown at SMSound.onload (now says SMSound._onload() as previously.)\n\n        soundManager.sounds = {} instead of [] on reboot (per bug report)\n\n        Fix logic for calling onplay(), was always non-truthy. D'oh!\n\n        Add missing typeof to fix html5 MIME check for playability tests\n\n        Don't apply width:auto to SWF (invalid per HTML5, allegedly: Related patch.)\n\n        Make soundManager.canPlayMIME() and canPlayLink() check flash support before returning (check after ontimeout() was returning truthy when flash required under Firefox, for example, for 'audio/mp3')\n\n        Fix play() \"from\" + \"to\" sound sprite playback issue: In some cases, previously-fired \"to\" events were re-firing due to not being removed, because an equality check was comparing against a potential \"to\" value of a string rather than a number. (eg., 0-700 followed by 1500-2000; playback would stop in second case, saying 700 had been reached. (Related bug report.)\n\n        Re-appeased the jslint gods, removed unused variables and two-statement reverse loop (for i=x; i--;) { } trickery.\n\n    Miscellaneous\n\n        The SoundManager project turned 10 years old, having originally launched in late 2001. Thanks for using it!\n",
