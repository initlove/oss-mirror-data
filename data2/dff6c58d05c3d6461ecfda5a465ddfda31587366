A bug was not filed,\nbut it was found and patched at roughly the same time.\n\n3 Fixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n3.1 Critical Fixes\n===================\n\n  * Malicious input can crash server. bug102\n\n3.2 Non-critical Fixes\n=======================\n\n  * Removed special case in slab sizing for factor 2. bug56\n  * Provide better errors for deletion scenarios. bug3\n  * Fix get stats accounting. bug104\n  * Ignore stats prefix for keys without a delimiter. bug96\n  * Work around rpm's broken concept of versions more. bug98\n  * Use slab class growth factor limit. bug57\n  * Added LSB section to init script. bug54\n  * Documentation fixes\n  * Various build fixes\n\n3.3 Itemized List of Bugs Closed\n=================================\n\nIf a bug shows up in this list that wasn't specifically mentioned\nabove, it's either too minor to mention specifically or the bug was\nclosed by introducing a test that proves that the bug, as described,\ndoes not exist.\n\n  * bug3\n  * bug54\n  * bug56\n  * bug57\n  * bug62\n  * bug67\n  * bug68\n  * bug69\n  * bug96\n  * bug97\n  * bug98\n  * bug101\n  * bug102\n  * bug104\n\n4 New Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n4.1 Support for SASL Authentication\n====================================\n\nSome installations of memcached are not in controlled environments\nwhere simple network filtering keeps bad guys out of your stuff.  To\nhelp with those other environments, we've introduced SASL support.\nYou can read more about it here:\n\n[http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/SASLHowto]\n\n4.2 New perl tool damemtop in scripts/\n=======================================\n\ndormando's awesome memcached top - a new commandline perl tool for\nmonitoring small to large memcached clusters. Supports monitoring\narbitrary statistics. See scripts/README.damemtop for more\ninformation.\n\nThis tool is intended to replace memcached-tool, but not yet.\n\n4.3 Also Noteworthy, Slab Optimizations\n========================================\n\nObjects on the larger end of the limit should be generally more memory\nefficient now as more slabs are created (thus are more granular).\n\n5 Contributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe following people contributed to this release since 1.4.2.\n\nNote that this is based on who contributed changes, not how they were\ndone.  In many cases, a code snippet on the mailing list or a bug\nreport ended up as a commit with your name on it.\n\nNote that this is just a summary of how many changes each person made\nwhich doesn't necessarily reflect how significant each change was.\nFor details on what led up into a branch, either grab the git repo and\nlook at the output of `git log 1.4.2..1.4.3` or use a web view.\n\n  * Repo list:  [http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/DevelopmentRepos]\n  * Web View: [http://github.com/memcached/memcached/commits/1.4.3]\n\n    15  Dustin Sallings\n    10  Trond Norbye\n     5  dormando\n     2  Colin Pitrat\n     1  Monty Taylor\n     1  Chang Song\n     1  CaptTofu\n     1  Tomash Brechko\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (Darwin)\n\niEYEABECAAYFAkr2HYUACgkQeWDnv0PlnVSrDwCdEEw1JYZbSy1q1iqcR9rZ0sNc\nXWcAnjdVzcpTE+qxpCHmThEwtyBLJmRg\n=R/+j\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
