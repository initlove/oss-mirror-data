The bug was fixed in 1.4.3.  If anyone was\nattempting to use it legitimately in the 1.4 series, it would simply\nnot work as expected.\n\nThe 1.4.4 backwards compatibility change allows specifically the value\nof 0 (i.e. non-lingering delete), while continuing to reject others.\nThis will satisfy clients that always wish to send a value even when\nthey do not wish the item to linger.\n\n4 New Features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n4.1 New Stats\n==============\n\n4.1.1 auth_enabled_sasl\n------------------------\n\nThis is a general stat that indicates whether SASL authentication is\nenabled or not.\n\n4.1.2 auth_cmds\n----------------\n\nIndicates the total number of authentication attempts.\n\n4.1.3 auth_errors\n------------------\n\nIndicates the number of failed authentication attempts.\n\n5 Contributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe following people contributed to this release since 1.4.3.\n\nNote that this is based on who contributed changes, not how they were\ndone.
