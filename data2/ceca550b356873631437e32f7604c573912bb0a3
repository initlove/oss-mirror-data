  "message": "Compatibility fixes and minor enhancements\n\n*   C Extensions are only compiled on MRI 1.9.x.\n\n    For MRI >= 2 the native API is used, so this should speedup\n    installation.\n\n    For JRuby this will avoid crashes on gem installation.\n\n    This was alredy being checked for Rubinius.\n\n    *Amadeus Folego*\n\n*    Added experimental JRuby support for 1.7.x series.\n\n     Only the main API is implemented and `Binding#eval` is\n     monkey-patched as it is private on JRuby.\n\n     This requires the compiler to be run on interpreted mode,\n     otherwise an exception will be thrown when `of_caller` is called.\n\n    *Charles Nutter*\n\n*   Remove executability from non-executable files.\n\n    *David Celis*\n\n*   Test and notice MRI 2.1 as a working Ruby implementation.\n\n    *Lennart Frid√©n*\n",
