  "message": "Version 5.0.0-beta8\n\nIf we're lucky this will be the last of the betas. The remaining potentially blocking issues have to do with improving `SerialPort.list` which would change their output. The two issues are #1220 and #1084. I need help on those two issues, if I'm not able to close them soon, I'll release anyway, and they'll be fixed for 6x. This release is large enough. -@reconbot\n\n- [linux] Add the `ttyAP` subsystem to serialport list thanks to @fly19890211 for reporting it\n- [all] Have drain wait for pending JS write operations before calling system drain thanks to @digitalhack for reporting it\n- [unix] Move setting up the baudrate to the end of the open() to better support custom baudrates\n",
