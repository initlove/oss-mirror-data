  "message": "0.20.0 / 2015-06-19\n-------------------\n- removed `jsonfile` aliases with `File` in the name, they weren't documented and probably weren't in use e.g.\nthis package had both `fs.readJsonFile` and `fs.readJson` that were aliases to each other, now use `fs.readJson`.\n- preliminary walker created. Intentionally not documented. If you use it, it will almost certainly change and break your code.\n- started moving tests inline\n- upgraded to `jsonfile@2.1.0`, can now pass JSON revivers/replacers to `readJson()`, `writeJson()`, `outputJson()`\n",
