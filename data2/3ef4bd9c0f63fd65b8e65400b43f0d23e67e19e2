  "message": "Docker Registry v2.3.0\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nThis Docker Registry release is the first to support the Image Manifest Version 2, Schema 2\nmanifest format.\n\nThis new schema version has two primary goals. The first is to move the Docker\nengine towards content-addressable images, by supporting an image model where\nthe image's configuration can be hashed to generate an ID for the image. The\nsecond is to allow multi-architecture images, through a \"fat manifest\" which\nreferences image manifests for platform-specific versions of an image.\n\nFor details, see https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md\n\nCross Repository Blob Mount\n\nPreviously the registry required all blob data to be uploaded to a repository,\neven if it existed in the Registry’s blob store.  This was a security measure to\nensure the clients owned the data they intended to upload.\n\nCross Repository Mount now enables an existing blob to be mounted into the target\nrepository if it already exists in a repository which the user has pull access\nto.  This can reduce the amount of data transferred when pushing images.\n\nFor details, see: https://github.com/docker/distribution/issues/634\n\nAdditionally there are a number of performance improvements, bug fixes and\ndocumentation updates.\n\nGotchas\n\nIn certain cases, pull by digest will not work.
