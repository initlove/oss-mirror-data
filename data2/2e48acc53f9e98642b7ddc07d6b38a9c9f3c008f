It is a wrapper for the hugetlbfs file\n     system.\n\nIf you are running memcached with a very large heap in Linux, this\nchange will make it available to you.  The hugetlbfs HOWTO provides\ndetailed information on how to configure your Linux system and provide\nadvice to applications (such as memcached) to make use of it.\n\n4.2 Support for evictions, evict_time and OOM counts in memcached-tool\n=======================================================================\n\nmemcached-tool is a commandline tool to display information about your\nserver.  It displays more now.\n\n4.3 Configurable maximum item size.\n====================================\n\nMany people have asked for memcached to be able to store items larger\nthan 1MB, while it's generally recommended that one *not* do this, it\nis now supported on the commandline.\n\nA few enlightened folk have also asked for memcached to reduce the\nmaximum item size.  That is also an option.\n\nThe new -I parameter allows you to specify the maximum item size at\nruntime.  It supports a unit postfix to allow for natural expression\nof item size.\n\nExamples:\n\nmemcached -I 128k # Refuse items larger than 128k.\nmemcached -I 10m  # Allow objects up to 10MB\n\n4.4 New stat: 'evicted_nonzero'\n================================\n\nThe evicted_nonzero stat is a counter of all of the evictions for\nitems that had an expiration time greater than zero.\n\nThis can be used to help distinguish \"healthy\" evictions from\n\"unhealthy\" ones.  If all of your evictions are for objects with no\nexpiration, then they're naturally falling off the LRU as opposed to\nbeing evicted before their maximum expiry that was set at item store\ntime.\n\n4.5 Protocol definitions for range protocol.\n=============================================\n\nmemcached ships with a binary protocol header that can be used when\nimplementing your own protocol parsers and generators.  The structure\ndefinitions and opcodes for the range specification are included in\nthis header.\n\nNote that the server *does not* support these operations.\n\n5 Contributors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe following people contributed to this release since 1.4.1.\n\nNote that this is based on who contributed changes, not how they were\ndone.  In many cases, a code snippet on the mailing list or a bug\nreport ended up as a commit with your name on it.\n\nNote that this is just a summary of how many changes each person made\nwhich doesn't necessarily reflect how significant each change was.\nFor details on what led up into a branch, either grab the git repo and\nlook at the output of `git log 1.4.1..1.4.2-rc1` or use a web view.\n\n  * Repo list:  [http://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/DevelopmentRepos]\n  * Web View: [http://github.com/memcached/memcached/commits/1.4.2-rc1]\n\n    16  Dustin Sallings\n     8  Trond Norbye\n     1  Mat Hostetter\n     1  Matt Ingenthron\n     1  Monty Taylor\n     1  Steve Yen\n     1  Adam Thomason\n     1  dormando\n     1  Cosimo Streppone\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: GnuPG v1.4.9 (Darwin)\n\niEYEABECAAYFAkrNjQUACgkQeWDnv0PlnVSV+gCfbvyY1/QASHZehh4/9obufb8a\nyXQAnRtRwvbWsZF/skCxByAcbebwn/qb\n=FNUw\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\n",
