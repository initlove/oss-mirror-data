  "message": "* Fixed dependency scopes for `metrics-jetty`.\n* Added time and VM version to `vm` output of `MetricsServlet`.\n* Dropped `com.sun.mangement`-based GC instrumentation in favor of a\n  `java.lang.management`-based one. `getLastGcInfo` has a nasty native memory\n  leak in it, plus it often returned incorrect data.\n* Upgraded to Jackson 1.8.5.\n* Upgraded to Jetty 7.4.5.\n* Added sanitization for metric names in `GraphiteReporter`.\n* Extracted out a `Clock` interface for timers for non-wall-clock timing.\n* Extracted out most of the remaining statics into `MetricsRegistry` and\n  `HealthCheckRegistry`.\n* Added an init parameter to `MetricsServlet` for disabling the `jvm` section.\n* Added a Guice module for `MetricsServlet`.\n* Added dynamic metric names.\n* Upgraded to ehcache 2.4.5.\n* Upgraded to logback 0.9.29.\n* Allowed for the removal of metrics.\n* Added the ability to filter metrics exposed by a reporter to those which match\n  a given predicate.\n",
