  "message": "v1.0.0~rc5\n\nThis is planned to be the final -rc release of runc. While we really\nhaven't followed the rules for release candidates (with huge features\nintroduced each release, and with massive gaps between releases) the\nhope is that once we've release 1.0.0 we will be much more liberal with\nreleases in future. Let's see how that pans out. :P\n\nFeatures:\n\n+ Support cgroups in rootless containers. This is a continuation of the\n  previous work done, and allows for users that have specialised setups\n  (such as having the LXC pam_cg.so module set up) to use cgroups with\n  rootless containers. #1540\n+ Add support for newuidmap and newgidmap with rootless containers.\n  This is a continuation of some previous work, and allows users that\n  have /etc/sub{uid,gid} configured to use the shadow-utils setuid\n  helpers. Note that this support doesn't restrict users that don't want\n  to use setuid binaries at all. #1529\n+ runc will now use a chroot when mount namespaces aren't provided in\n  the config.json. While chroot does have its (many) downsides, this\n  does allow for specialised configurations to work properly. #1702\n+ Expose annotations to hooks, so that the hook can have more direct\n  information about the container it is being run against. #1687\n+ Add \"runc exec --additional-gids\" support. #1608\n+ Allow more signals to be sent with \"runc kill\" than are defined by\n  Go's syscall package. #1706\n+ Emit an error if users try to use MS_PRIVATE with --no-pivot, as that\n  is simply not safe. #1606\n+ Add support for \"unbindable\" and \"runbindable\" as rootfs propagation.\n  #1655\n+ Implement intelrdt support in runc. #1279 #1590\n+ Add support for lazy migration with CRIU. This includes the addition\n  of \"runc checkpoint httpd\" which acts as a remote pagefault request\n  server. #1541\n+ Add MIPS support. #1475\n\nFixes:\n\n* Delay seccomp application as late as possible, to reduce the syscall\n  footprint of runc on profiles. #1569\n* Fix --read-only containers with user namespaces, which would\n  previously fail under Docker because of privilege problems when trying\n  to do the read-only remount. #1572\n* Switch away from stateDirFd entirely. This is an improvement over the\n  protections we added for CVE-2016-9962, and protects against many\n  other possible container escape bugs. #1570\n* Handle races between \"runc start\" and \"runc delete\" over the exec FIFO\n  correctly, and avoid blocking \"runc start\" indefinitely. #1698\n* Correctly generate seccomp profiles that place requirements on syscall\n  arguments, as well as multi-argument restrictions. #1616 #1424\n* Prospective patch for remounting of old-root during pivot_root. This\n  is intended to solve one of the many \"mount leak\" bugs that have been\n  popping up recently -- caused by lots of container churn and host\n  mounts being pinned during container setup. #1500\n* Fix \"runc exec\" on big-endian architectures. #1727\n* Correct systemd slice expansion to work with cAdvisor. #1722\n* Fix races against systemd cgroup scope creation. #1683\n* Do not wait for signalled processes if libcontainer is running in a\n  process that is a subreaper. #1678\n* Remove dependency on libapparmor entirely, and just use\n  /proc/$pid/attr directly. #1675\n* Improvements to our integration tests. #1661 #1629 #1528\n* Handle systemd's quirky CPUQuotaPerSecUSec handling in\n  fractions-of-a-percent edge-cases. #1651\n* Remove docker/docker import in runc by moving the package to runc.\n  #1644\n* Switch from docker's pkg/symlink to cyphar/filepath-securejoin. #1622\n* Enable integration and unit tests on arm64. #1642 #1640\n* Add /proc/scsi to masked paths (mirror of Docker's CVE-2017-16539).\n  #1641\n* Add several tests for specconv. #1626 #1619\n* Add more extensive tests for terminal handling. #1357\n* Always write freezer state during retry-loop, to avoid an indefinite\n  hang when new tasks are spawned in the container. #1610\n* Create cwd when it doesn't exist in the container. #1604\n* Set initial console size based on process spec, to avoid SIGWINCH\n  races where initial console size is completely wrong. #1275\n* Small fixes for static builds. #1579 #1577\n* Use epoll for PTY IO, to avoid issues with systemd's SAK protections.\n  #1455\n* Update state.json after a \"runc update\". #1558\n* Switch to umoci's release scripts, to use a more \"standardised\" and\n  distribution-friendly release scheme. Several makefile-fixes included\n  as well. #1554 #1542 #1555\n* Reap \"runc:[1:CHILD]\" to avoid intermediate zombies building up. #1506\n* Use CRIU's RPC to check the version. #1535\n* Always save own namespace paths rather than the path given during\n  start-up, to avoid issues where the path disappears afterwards. #1477\n* Fix that we incorrectly set the owners of devices. This is still (subtly)\n  broken in user namespaces, but will be fixed in a future version. #1743\n\n* Lots of other miscellaneous fixes and cleanups, many of which were\n  written by first-time contributors.
