  "tag": "1.0.1",
  "message": "Tagged as version 1.0.1. This version is mostly a bugfix update, including a crash fix for IE (when using background images on HTML element), and preserving attribute selector support in IE7+. Other fixes include syntax stability for @media statements, and the external inclusion of the window.matchMedia polyfill, rather than including a separate polyfill internally. If you're already including a window.matchMedia polyfill via Modernizr or otherwise, you can delete it from the top of Respond.js for file savings.\n",
