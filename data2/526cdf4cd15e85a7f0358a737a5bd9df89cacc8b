  "tag": "0.4.0",
  "message": "Version 0.4.0, with the following fixes and new features:\n\n- Direct support for login_hint in authorization requests\n- Introduction of AppAuthConfiguration, with allows an app to:\n    - Control which browser(s) can be used for the authorization flow, through the use of a `BrowserMatcher`. A variety of generally useful browser matcher implementations are provided in the \"browser\" package.\n    - Control over the creation of HttpURLConnection, through the use of a `ConnectionBuilder`. This allows for the use of alternative HTTP stacks (e.g. okhttp), disabling of certificate checks (for testing), and certificate pinning.\n- The library will work without a browser, for use cases that only require token exchange, such as when the token is bootstrapped through some other means. Authorization requests still require a browser.\n- Better handling of the back stack and authorization request state - switching apps during the authorization flow will no longer kill the flow.\n- Apps can provide a \"cancel\" intent in addition to a completion intent, in order to better handle cancelation of the authorization flow.\n",
