  "message": "Mail 2.7.0.rc1\n\nFeatures:\n* #804 - Configurable SMTP open_timeout and read_timeout. (ankane)\n* #853 - `Mail::Message#set_sort_order` overrides the default message part sort order. (rafbm)\n* #650 - UTF-7 charset support. (johngrimes)\n* #1065 - Require STARTTLS using :enable_starttls. (bk2204)\n* #1002 - Transcoding replaces invalid chars with \"�\" instead of discarding them. (kjg)\n* #1094 - Core extensions removal: Drop `String#at`, `from`, `last` and `is_utf8?` since they are no longer used by Mail internals. (metcalf)\n* #1095 - Core extensions removal: Drop `String#mb_chars`, `not_ascii_only?`, `constantize`, `first`, `to` to avoid monkey patching the standard library. (metcalf)\n\nPerformance:\n* #1059 - Switch from mime-types to mini_mime for a much smaller memory footprint. (SamSaffron)\n\nCompatibility:\n* #464 - Improve attachment filename detection by preferring Content-Disposition filename. (lawrencepit)\n* #655 - Sort attachments to the end of the parts list to work around email clients that may mistake a text attachment for the message body. (npickens)\n* #982 – Faithfully preserve unfolded whitespace rather than collapsing to a single space. (jeremy)\n\nBugs:\n* #539 - Fix that whitespace-only continued headers would be incorrectly parsed as the break between headers and body. (ConradIrwin)\n* #876 - Strip valid RFC-1342 separator characters between non-matching encoded-words (Caleb W. Corliss)\n* #978 - Fix for invalid chars being left in a string for invalid b_value from encoding. (kjg)\n* #996 - Fix that multipart/mixed emails with a delivery-status part could be interpreted as bounces. (kjg)\n* #998 - Fix header parameter parsing (such as attachment names) for values encoded with a blank charset or language code. (kjg)\n* #1000 - Fix header parameter parsing (such as attachment names) to transcode to UTF-8 (kjg)\n* #1020 - Don't set SMTP verify mode to nil when config was not provided. (jhass)\n* #1032 - Fix that comparing messages changed their raw Message-ID to their parsed message_id. (bobjflong)\n* #1074 - Fix that the first address in a list is dropped when a subsequent address has non-US-ASCII characters. (domininik)\n",
