  "message": "What's new in Tornado 3.2.1\n===========================\n\nMay 5, 2014\n-----------\n\nSecurity fixes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* The signed-value format used by `.RequestHandler.set_secure_cookie`\n  and `.RequestHandler.get_secure_cookie` has changed to be more secure.\n  **This is a disruptive change**.  The ``secure_cookie`` functions\n  take new ``version`` parameters to support transitions between cookie\n  formats.\n* The new cookie format fixes a vulnerability that may be present in\n  applications that use multiple cookies where the name of one cookie\n  is a prefix of the name of another.\n* To minimize disruption, cookies in the older format will be accepted\n  by default until they expire.  Applications that may be vulnerable\n  can reject all cookies in the older format by passing ``min_version=2``\n  to `.RequestHandler.get_secure_cookie`.\n\nBackwards-compatibility notes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* Signed cookies issued by `.RequestHandler.set_secure_cookie` in Tornado\n  3.2.1 cannot be read by older releases.  If you need to run 3.2.1\n  in parallel with older releases, you can pass ``version=1`` to\n  `.RequestHandler.set_secure_cookie` to issue cookies that are\n  backwards-compatible (but have a known weakness, so this option\n  should only be used for a transitional period).\n\nOther changes\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n* The C extension used to speed up the websocket module now compiles\n  correctly on Windows with MSVC and 64-bit mode.  The fallback to\n  the pure-Python alternative now works correctly on Mac OS X machines\n  with no C compiler installed.\n",
